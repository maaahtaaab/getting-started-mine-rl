Your task: Implement behavioural cloning for MineRLTreechop-v0.

Behavioural cloning is perhaps the simplest way of using a dataset of demonstrations to train an agent:
learn to predict what actions they would take, and take those actions.
In other machine learning terms, this is almost like building a classifier to classify observations to
different actions, and taking those actions.

For simplicity, we build a limited set of actions ("agent actions"), map dataset actions to these actions
and train on the agent actions. During evaluation, we transform these agent actions (integerse) back into
MineRL actions (dictionaries).

To do this task, fill in the "TODO"s and remove `raise NotImplementedError`s.

Note: For this task you need to download the "MineRLTreechop-v0" dataset. See here:
https://minerl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/data_sampling.html#downloading-the-minerl-dataset-with-minerl-data-download
